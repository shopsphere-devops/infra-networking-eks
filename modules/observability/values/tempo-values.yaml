    trace:
      backend: local # This tells Tempo to use local disk storage for trace data.
      # All traces are stored on the pod’s filesystem.
      # This is simple and fine for dev/test, but not recommended for production
      # (where you’d use object storage like S3, GCS, etc. for durability and scalability).
  server:
    http_listen_port: 3100 # This sets the HTTP server port for Tempo to 3100.
    # This is the default port for Tempo’s HTTP API.
    # Other services (like Grafana, or the OpenTelemetry Collector) will connect to Tempo on this port to send or query traces.
